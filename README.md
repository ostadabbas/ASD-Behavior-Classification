### 1. Requirements ###

Due to dependency issues between different frameworks, there are two different enviornemnts which are needed to be setup for execution of different processes. 
We work around two frameworks - Caffe and Tensorflow. This is primarily because of the algorithms in use. Caffe is needed to run the Pose Estimation network which is a version of Detect and Track based on Facebook's Detectron.
For rest of all algorithms including PoTion and Classification, we have used Tensorflow. There are two requirements files that solve enviornments for both the frameworks. 
Please follow the steps in order to prepare the enviornments.

* Preparing for Pose Estimation

For pose estimation the requirement file is requirement_caffe.txt
Please create a conda enviornment using this file which contains all the necessary libraries and dependencies.
